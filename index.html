	<p>What I really miss is at the end of the school day before we get on our different school bus we go "are you going to be on tonight" then an hour later the little figure on msn messenger turns green and we go "hi" "hi" "lol" "lol" for an hour before homework time or when I have to go to swim team training. I think that's the affect Instagram DM is trying to go for.</p>

<p>Accidentally listening to jazz made me want to die a little so I am back on Aphex Twin Selected Soundcloud Works.</p>
	<p>I ended up going through the list of my following on tumblr tonight. I came across my good friend's old tumblr that ended after her first year of living in New York—both of our first year in New York, in fact. She was my first roommate. Back then, we lived in the shittiest apartment in the nicest starter neighborhood (Crown Heights) that when we showed prospective tenants the apartment in the last month of our lease, I would compare it to the coffin apartment in Notes from the Underground. On her tumblr, my roommate wrote about events familiar to me from a more poetic distance. She was so in love back then, and then so tortured, always in ache; always missing someone, getting over someone. For a while it was as if all we did was sit around in that windowless apartment, under the skylight covered by snow, and feel.</p>
	<p>Another tumblr that I used to follow was a guide to "how to live in Beijing" from ten years ago, when Google Maps was still helpful and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140419093910/http://www.smartbeijing.com/articles/activities/offbeat-the-mongolia-visa-run" target="_blank">F visa still existed</a>. I am curious about how many of the tips are still valid today. Going through the posts pulled me back into imagining of wanting to move somewhere as a teenager—a yearning that feels inaccessible now. How strange that after all, we made some of our dreams come true. Finally, I am at a place in my life where I can feel alive without the impulse to document. I have friends whom I miss and friends who miss me. I worked jobs that I had worked really hard to get. I went to places that I said I would go to. I have loved—a little, a lot, enough. But yearning—I haven't been earnest enough to yearn for anything since 2014.</p>

Just remembered after hiking, when I was slightly fucked up from vaping and drinking red wine on an empty stomach, my friend Tom was like, what do you want? And I was like, I'm good scrolling on my phone, and he was like, what do you want? And I was like, I want to scroll on my phone, and he was like, no what do you want in life? and I—

If you have to send a difficult text, it’s best to send it at 5 or 6AM, so that it’s the first thing the other person sees when they wake up, but even if they respond to it right away, you don’t have to respond to their response right away, assuming the powerful ambiguity of you either didn’t sleep until 5 or 6AM, or you could have woken up at 5 or 6AM and fallen back asleep at 8 or 9AM. It’s kind of like leaving important documents at your boss’s desk after they leave for the day so that they are the first thing they see the next morning, without you having to go through the anxious motions of interpreting their mood, knocking on their door and interrupting their day. This way, you are also set up to get over the most difficult thing with first thing the next day. Control the narrative.
