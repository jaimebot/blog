Here's where we will fill in all your work.
The h3 and h4 are your headers. These help split the links into categories.
The <a ... part is a link.

Replace the google link with the link to your Work
Replace "Work Title [Journal]" with whatever you like.

The <br> is a line brake. This makes sure each link is on a new line.

<h3>Friday, 17 January, 2020</h3>

<p>If you have to send a difficult text, it’s best to send it at 5 or 6AM, so that it’s the first thing the other person sees when they wake up, but even if they respond to it right away, you don’t have to respond to their response right away, assuming the powerful ambiguity of you either didn’t sleep until 5 or 6AM, or you could have woken up at 5 or 6AM and fallen back asleep at 8 or 9AM. It’s kind of like leaving important documents at your boss’s desk after they leave for the day so that they are the first thing they see the next morning, without you having to go through the anxious motions of interpreting their mood, knocking on their door and interrupting their day. This way, you are also set up to get over the most difficult thing with first thing the next day. Control the narrative.</p>
