On and off, we would see each other through Krish. I really didn’t pay much attention to him at first. The things we had in common weren’t immediate. I just thought of him as an opinionated but somewhat reserved friend of a friend, who always have a lot to say about any topic. The turning point was perhaps a month ago, when we went to see Ten Years at Krish’s place. I surprised myself by looking forward to seeing Simon there. And then when I arrived, I completely froze up, without even knowing why.

Krish’s internet service went out at the end of night. The next morning, he made a group chat to update us on his internet, and I suppose it was since then that we became closer.

It’s weird because usually I am pretty quick at responding to mutual admiration or interest. By the time I caught onto feeling like I am not witty or intellectual or knowledgeable for his attention sometimes, it made me feel some type of challenged way.

The only point of insecurity I feel that we are not “real friends” is that we have not initiated hanging out with each other. (Even Henry and I have hung out!) And every time he has an event or something he would always vaguely invite the other person in the group but not me directly. Like that time at C5 when Henry mentioned we failed to go to see the Tai Kang show that afternoon, he said to Henry, text me next Sunday, even though it was both of our plans. (Granted, he and Henry have known each other for longer and are better friends.) But somehow that night, the two of us ended up at Zhaodai after everyone went home one after another like exiting the freeway. (Best remix of Toxic.) 

You have a lot of power if you don’t care!!! 

I was actually a little nervous that night because Henry walked us to Zhaodai but somehow didn’t want to go in, and I didn’t want to seem like I just wanted to hang out with Simon. I had already been committed to techno from the beginning of the night, but failed to rally Hanna in the end after the show at C5. So somehow the two of us ended up at Zhaodai at 1AM. He immediately bought me a drink, remembering the joke I made at C5 when Hanna asked “what’s at Zhaodai” and I said “…basil sour for 50 kuai?” I remember texting Clare about how psychotic it was that he set an alarm to leave at 2:30AM. (“Do I have a new crush or do I just feel refreshingly alienated?”)

Thinking about the club nights that were certifiably good. What makes me go, that was a good party. 

-The afterparty of Eddie’s book launch at the Gramercy Rose Bar. I felt like a child at a party where all the cool adults were—Mary, Eddie’s brothers, Eddie’s brothers’ friends—but still managed to meet people and dance. None of my actual friends were there except for Rocky. I do not remember taking a selfie with Rocky until Clare pulled it out of her phone randomly two years later. 
-Boiler Room party at Sugar Hill. Larissa and I went together; we narrowly missed Jeesoo after the main set but we overlapped at some point enough to agree that Shyboi slapped. 
-Random party at Mood Ring when Selene visited where some Eastern European dude tried to breathe down my neck and we still had fun DESPITE.
-A homicidally freezing night at Nowadays, a few weeks before I left New York. For some reason, we had to stand in line for an hour to get in (because we probably fucked up and left the house too late and didn’t get in early like the earth signs did). June was also there for some reason. I was SO COLD that Clare texted Tom who came out specifically to lend me his Margiela jacket (“I am not gonna throw that over the fence!”), which was NOT warm but it was better than nothing. (Thank you Tom.) We took some Vyvanse. The fog machine was on overload as usual. Later, Larissa and I went into a k-hole briefly. Was it the same night that we also went to Unter around the corner? I can’t remember. Had to pay $40 cover at the door. Not all of us had cash and so some of us went home. Unter was too bright. A sweaty warehouse. I only pressured myself into it because it was supposedly the last big night out before the move. 
-Mood Ring when Ellen DJ’d and we talked for like so long on the dance floor after her set while her boyfriend in a grey hoodie with the hood up kind of hovered in a benign way. Some other Twitter mutual was there, too. Can’t remember if Clare and I were on drugs. Probably.
-Going to Bossa alone one Halloween. 
-There were probably some good parties at China Chalet before Jenna Lyons showed up one night.
-Elsewhere when Izzy DJ’d on a chill night.
-I wouldn’t say this was a good party but it was definitely memorable. That one really chaotic night at Elsewhere when a. I forgot my keys and became dependent on Larissa. b. Larissa and Chris were power-move fighting whereby she wanted to go home with him or at least be offered the option and they were just kind of having tension on the dancefloor all night long until it was decided that she wasn’t gonna go home with him and we went home. c. Meanwhile Jeesoo and John were there somewhere and we played hide and seek all night long. No one could find anyone between the little room, the big room, and the up stairs room. I almost got kicked out for trying to smoke on top of a stairwell.

<p><BR>If you have to send a difficult text, it’s best to send it at 5 or 6AM, so that it’s the first thing the other person sees when they wake up, but even if they respond to it right away, you don’t have to respond to their response right away, assuming the powerful ambiguity of you either didn’t sleep until 5 or 6AM, or you could have woken up at 5 or 6AM and fallen back asleep at 8 or 9AM. It’s kind of like leaving important documents at your boss’s desk after they leave for the day so that they are the first thing they see the next morning, without you having to go through the anxious motions of interpreting their mood, knocking on their door and interrupting their day. This way, you are also set up to get over the most difficult thing with first thing the next day. Control the narrative.</p>
