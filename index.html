	<h3>Friday, 7 February, 2020</h3>
	<p>A spontaneous four-day trip has turned into two weeks and counting. Last night, the news came that Dr. Li Wenliang, one of the first doctors who had warned their colleagues about the coronavirus, had passed away from the pneumonia he contracted and the internet went into mourning. This morning, I became restless and looked up plane tickets to the nearest country where I may breathe freely—that is, without fear. Vietnam seems reasonable. And it has not yet imposed quarantines on travelers from Hong Kong.</p>
	<p>But when has it not been "a weird time in my life?" I feel like I often have this urge to "sit down and sort out my life." The problem is every time I sit down, there is, inevitably, something else to sort out that is not "my life."</p>

	<h3>Hong Kong food diary</h3>
	<p>1.</p>
	<p>At New Punjab Club, we had the tandoori cobia, the saag paneer, the butter chicken, and naan. By the time we left, we also talked ourselves into the banana walnut pudding with popcorn ice-cream and a flight of Indian whiskey. Our server poured us a few splashes of Johnny Walker Black Label at the end of our meal. Y and R both teach architecture at the university. We met up at the club last night. Going out in Hong Kong  isn't rooted in any kind of pathways of habit. Parties are out of the way. The music is  not often convincing if you are not already a fan. The main attraction of Minh used to be the vending machines that sold high balls and gin and tonics in cans that you could pay for with the tap of an octopus card—a pure tactile high. Outside of Cipher last night, Y and R's friend got us molly from two kids on the curb (we only saw him pulling up his HSBC QR code.) The molly didn't hit until I was on my way back to the hotel an hour and a half later. I shivered and skipped the whole way downhill from Y's building. The security guard at the hotel yelled at me when I tried to get into an out-of-service elevator. "The door was open," I said, confused and justified.</p>
	<p>After dinner, R floated the idea of going to Oma, in that "haha...what if..." way that I could never say no to, but Y had to go into the office the next day. R walked with us to the west side. We agreed that it would be nice to come back for just the banana pudding and an espresso or some whiskey.</p>
  <p>2.</p>
  <p>It is possible that by the time I sat down I was already tipsy from the old fashioned at happy hour with J across the street. Almost instantly, we agreed on the chicken pate appetizer and all of the signature dishes. There is a certain generosity that I like when dining with S, not in terms of how much we eat, but how willingly we say yes to things.</p>
  <p>A friend who will be visiting Hong Kong asked about New Punjab Club and I gave him an honest report. It was <i>perfect</i>, but it didn't feel inspired. I supposed it depends on what you look for in a dining experience. I noticed that my New York recommendations for him was full of places that I described as "fun, chill, with a surprise." When a menu feels "inspired," I mean that it has a certain spirit that puts the story together—when I read the menu and understand the decisions that you are making.</p>
  <p>3.</p>
  <p>The most perfect date I have been on was still that Monday evening a year and a half ago when it was balmy and there was some mezze and a bottle of white wine between us and I was telling him about leaving New York. After dinner, we had two drinks on the balcony at VEA and watched the billboards in Central turn off at midnight.</p>

<p>Accidentally listening to jazz made me want to die a little so I am back on Aphex Twin Selected Soundcloud Works.</p>
	<p>I ended up going through the list of my following on tumblr tonight. I came across my good friend's old tumblr that ended after her first year of living in New York—both of our first year in New York, in fact. She was my first roommate. Back then, we lived in the shittiest apartment in the nicest starter neighborhood (Crown Heights) that when we showed prospective tenants the apartment in the last month of our lease, I would compare it to the coffin apartment in Notes from the Underground. On her tumblr, my roommate wrote about events familiar to me from a more poetic distance. She was so in love back then, and then so tortured, always in ache; always missing someone, getting over someone. For a while it was as if all we did was sit around in that windowless apartment, under the skylight covered by snow, and feel.</p>
	<p>Another tumblr that I used to follow was a guide to "how to live in Beijing" from ten years ago, when Google Maps was still helpful and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140419093910/http://www.smartbeijing.com/articles/activities/offbeat-the-mongolia-visa-run" target="_blank">F visa still existed</a>. I am curious about how many of the tips are still valid today. Going through the posts pulled me back into imagining of wanting to move somewhere as a teenager—a yearning that feels inaccessible now. How strange that after all, we made some of our dreams come true. Finally, I am at a place in my life where I can feel alive without the impulse to document. I have friends whom I miss and friends who miss me. I worked jobs that I had worked really hard to get. I went to places that I said I would go to. I have loved—a little, a lot, enough. But yearning—I haven't been earnest enough to yearn for anything since 2014.</p>

Just remembered after hiking, when I was slightly fucked up from vaping and drinking red wine on an empty stomach, my friend Tom was like, what do you want? And I was like, I'm good scrolling on my phone, and he was like, what do you want? And I was like, I want to scroll on my phone, and he was like, no what do you want in life? and I—

If you have to send a difficult text, it’s best to send it at 5 or 6AM, so that it’s the first thing the other person sees when they wake up, but even if they respond to it right away, you don’t have to respond to their response right away, assuming the powerful ambiguity of you either didn’t sleep until 5 or 6AM, or you could have woken up at 5 or 6AM and fallen back asleep at 8 or 9AM. It’s kind of like leaving important documents at your boss’s desk after they leave for the day so that they are the first thing they see the next morning, without you having to go through the anxious motions of interpreting their mood, knocking on their door and interrupting their day. This way, you are also set up to get over the most difficult thing with first thing the next day. Control the narrative.
