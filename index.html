<h3>Saturday, 18 January, 2020</h3
 
<p>
On and off, we would see each other through Krish. I really didn’t pay much attention to him at first. The things we had in common weren’t immediate. I just thought of him as an opinionated but somewhat reserved friend of a friend, who always have a lot to say about any topic. The turning point was perhaps a month ago, when we went to see Ten Years at Krish’s place. I surprised myself by looking forward to seeing Simon there. And then when I arrived, I completely froze up, without even knowing why.

Krish’s internet service went out at the end of night. The next morning, he made a group chat to update us on his internet, and I suppose it was since then that we became closer.

It’s weird because usually I am pretty quick at responding to mutual admiration or interest. By the time I caught onto feeling like I am not witty or intellectual or knowledgeable for his attention sometimes, it made me feel some type of challenged way.

<p><BR>If you have to send a difficult text, it’s best to send it at 5 or 6AM, so that it’s the first thing the other person sees when they wake up, but even if they respond to it right away, you don’t have to respond to their response right away, assuming the powerful ambiguity of you either didn’t sleep until 5 or 6AM, or you could have woken up at 5 or 6AM and fallen back asleep at 8 or 9AM. It’s kind of like leaving important documents at your boss’s desk after they leave for the day so that they are the first thing they see the next morning, without you having to go through the anxious motions of interpreting their mood, knocking on their door and interrupting their day. This way, you are also set up to get over the most difficult thing with first thing the next day. Control the narrative.</p>
